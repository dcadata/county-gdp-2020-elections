# County-level analysis of GDP and 2020 election results


**[Visualizations - Tableau Public workbook with 4 tabs](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/devon.ankar/viz/UScountiesbyGDPandelectionresults/GDPwinner)**

Data from some counties is missing. Data available for only 3063 counties.

## GDP

Via [BEA - GDP by County, Metro, and Other Areas](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gdp-county-metro-and-other-areas). From [this page](https://apps.bea.gov/regional/downloadzip.cfm), I downloaded the dataset "CAGDP1: GDP Summary by County and MSA". County data was used in this analysis, and GDP is in current-dollar GDP (thousands of current dollars).

Used 2019 data because 2020 data not available yet.

## Population

Population estimates from [this page](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html): "Datasets" > "Population, Population Change, and Estimated Components of Population Change: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2019 (CO-EST2019-alldata)"

## Election Results

County-level election returns via [MIT Election Data and Science Lab (MEDSL)](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ):
